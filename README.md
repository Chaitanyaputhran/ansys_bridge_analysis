## Introduction

In this project, we use ANSYS software to analyze the structural behavior of bridges. The analysis includes factors such as load distribution, stress, displacement, and more. The goal is to provide an educational resource for understanding bridge engineering principles and simulation techniques.

## Features

- Perform static and dynamic analysis of bridges.
- Visualize the stress and displacement distribution.
- Explore the impact of different loads and environmental conditions.
- Educational tool for learning about structural engineering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ANSYS software installed (version XYZ)
- Python (optional for automation)
- Bridge geometry and load data

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chaitanyaputhran/ansys_bridge_analysis.git
   cd ansys-bridge-analysis
## Usage

1. Open the ANSYS project file located in the `project_files` directory.
2. Launch ANSYS software and open the project file.
3. Set up the bridge geometry and apply appropriate boundary conditions.
4. Define the loads (live loads, dead loads, etc.).
5. Run the analysis and observe the results.
6. For automated analysis, you can use the provided Python scripts in the `scripts` directory.

## Examples

Check out the `examples` directory to see sample input files and analysis results.
